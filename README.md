# DnDcharacterRandomizer
A Java-based Android Studio project I made as a final project for my ECSU CSC 380 class.

The app is designed to generate 1 to 25 randomized DnD characters.
The character name, ability scores, race, and class are all randomly chosen and then presented to the user to view.
As it is a randomizer, many times the ability scores don't match the class appropriately.

I have plans to improve the UI in the future, as currently there is no indicator for the user to double-tap the screen to switch between which randomly generated DnD character they are viewing.

Below is an example screenshot of the app's main screen that displays when the app launches.
